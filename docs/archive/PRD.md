# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Dash Xsadev - Personal Task Management System

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** August 18, 2026
**Product Owner:** [User]
**Status:** Draft

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Product Vision
Dash Xsadev is a personal task management system designed to overcome the limitations of existing todo applications like Todoist. The application provides a customizable workflow with webhook-based deadline notifications, similar to Uptime Kuma's notification system, enabling users to receive alerts through any service that supports HTTP webhooks.

### 1.2 Problem Statement
Current todo list applications (specifically Todoist) have several limitations:
- Premium features required for reminder functionality
- Inflexible workflow customization
- Limited notification options (locked to specific integrations)
- No support for custom webhook-based notifications
- Restricted ability to integrate with personal monitoring systems

### 1.3 Solution
A self-hosted, browser-based task management application that:
- Provides unlimited task creation and organization
- Supports webhook notifications for deadline reminders
- Allows complete workflow customization
- Integrates with existing monitoring tools (like Uptime Kuma)
- Runs locally without external dependencies
- Uses Meta's proven commerce design system for familiar UX

### 1.4 Target Audience
- Developers who want programmatic access to task notifications
- Privacy-conscious users who prefer self-hosted solutions
- Users with complex notification workflows
- Teams already using webhook-based monitoring systems

## 5. Design System Compliance

All UI components MUST follow the Meta design system defined in DESIGN.md:

### 5.1 Color Usage Rules
- `{colors.primary}` (cobalt): ONLY for webhook CTAs and notification-related actions
- `{colors.ink-button}` (black): Marketing surface CTAs ("Create Task", "Add Project")
- `{colors.success}`: Task completed, webhook success
- `{colors.critical}`: Overdue tasks, webhook failures, errors
- `{colors.warning}`: Promotional banners, limited-time offers
- `{colors.canvas}`: Page background
- `{colors.hairline-soft}`: Card borders

### 5.2 Typography Rules
- Hero: `{typography.hero-display}` (64px) for welcome screen
- Section headers: `{typography.heading-lg}` (36px)
- Card titles: `{typography.heading-sm}` (24px)
- Body: `{typography.body-md}` (16px)
- Buttons: `{typography.button-md}` (14px)
- Captions: `{typography.caption}` (12px)
- Headings MUST use `ss01, ss02` stylistic sets
- Negative letter-spacing on body roles (-0.14px to -0.16px)

### 5.3 Component Patterns
- Primary buttons: `{rounded.full}` (pill-shaped), ALWAYS
- Cards: `{rounded.xxxl}` for task cards, `{rounded.xl}` for icon features
- Inputs: `text-input` with `{rounded.lg}`
- Badges: `{rounded.full}` with appropriate color
- Section spacing: `{spacing.section}` (64px)
- Card padding: `{spacing.xxl}` (32px)

### 5.4 Layout Rules
- Max-width: 1280px for main content
- 2-column splits: 58%/42% (task content/settings)
- Feature grids: 3-up or 4-up with 24px gap
- Sticky rails: 42% width, max 380px
- Hero sections: 50-70% viewport height for imagery/branding

## 8. Risks & Mitigations

### 8.1 Technical Risks

**Risk:** LocalStorage limitations (5-10MB)
- **Mitigation:** Implement data compression, archive old tasks, provide export/import

**Risk:** Webhook delivery failures
- **Mitigation:** Retry logic, detailed logging, user notification of failures

**Risk:** Browser compatibility issues
- **Mitigation:** Progressive enhancement, polyfills, browser testing

### 8.2 Product Risks

**Risk:** User finds onboarding complex
- **Mitigation:** Simplify initial setup, provide video tutorial, offer "skip" options

**Risk:** Webhook configuration too technical
- **Mitigation:** Provide templates, presets for common services (Slack, Discord, etc.)

**Risk:** Limited functionality compared to Todoist
- **Mitigation:** Focus on webhook differentiation, emphasize privacy/self-hosting

## 9. Open Questions

1. **Multi-device sync:** Should we implement cross-device sync via a backend service, or keep purely local?
2. **Mobile app:** Should we prioritize PWA or native mobile app?
3. **Collaboration:** Should we add sharing/collaboration features in future iterations?
4. **Integrations:** Should we build preset integrations for common services (Slack, Discord, Telegram)?
5. **Recurring tasks:** Should we implement recurring task patterns?

## 10. Appendix

### 10.1 Terminology
- **Task:** A single to-do item with title, description, deadline, status
- **Project:** A collection of related tasks
- **Webhook:** An HTTP endpoint that receives notifications
