## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
Dash Xsadev is a standalone browser-based application that:
- Runs entirely in the client's browser
- Uses no external APIs or services
- Stores all data locally in browser localStorage
- Can be served using any static file server (e.g., `python3 -m http.server`)
- Functions as a single-page application (SPA)

### 2.2 Product Functions
| Function | Description | Priority |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Task Management | Create, read, update, delete tasks | Mandatory |
| Project Organization | Group tasks into projects | Mandatory |
| Webhook Notifications | Send deadline alerts via HTTP | Mandatory |
| Dashboard View | Overview of tasks and deadlines | Mandatory |
| Data Persistence | Save to localStorage | Mandatory |
| Export/Import | Backup and restore data | Optional |
| Task Templates | Reusable task patterns | Optional |
| Bulk Operations | Perform actions on multiple tasks | Optional |

### 2.3 User Characteristics
- **Primary Users:** Developers, privacy-conscious individuals, power users
- **Technical Proficiency:** Intermediate to advanced
- **Expected Environment:** Modern web browser, desktop or mobile
- **Usage Pattern:** Daily interaction, periodic webhook monitoring

### 2.4 Constraints
- **Storage:** Browser localStorage limitations (typically 5-10MB)
- **Network:** Webhook delivery depends on user's network connectivity
- **Browser:** Must support modern JavaScript (ES6+), localStorage, and CSS Grid
- **Execution:** Client-side only, no server-side processing
- **Security:** Cannot make HTTP requests to CORS-restricted endpoints without proper configuration

### 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
- **Assumptions:**
  - User has modern web browser with localStorage enabled
  - User's browser supports ES6+ JavaScript features
  - User has network connectivity for webhook delivery
  - User understands webhook concepts and can configure endpoints

- **Dependencies:**
  - Tailwind CSS (via CDN for development, build for production)
  - Modern browser with ES6+ support
  - Static file server for development

## 8. Verification & Validation

### 8.1 Verification Methods

#### 8.1.1 Code Review
- All code reviewed against requirements
- Design system compliance verified
- Security audit performed
- Performance testing conducted

#### 8.1.2 Automated Testing
```javascript
// Example test structure
describe('Task Management', () => {
  test('should create task with valid data', () => {
    const task = new Task({
      title: 'Test Task',
      description: 'Test description'
    });
    expect(task.id).toBeDefined();
    expect(task.title).toBe('Test Task');
  });

  test('should reject task with invalid title', () => {
    expect(() => {
      new Task({ title: '' });  // Empty title
    }).toThrow('Title is required');
  });

  test('should save to localStorage within 100ms', async () => {
    const start = performance.now();
    await taskService.createTask(validTaskData);
    const duration = performance.now() - start;
    expect(duration).toBeLessThan(100);
  });
});
```

#### 8.1.3 Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Task creation with all field combinations
- [ ] Task editing and deletion
- [ ] Project creation and management
- [ ] Webhook configuration and testing
- [ ] Notification delivery (manual time manipulation)
- [ ] Data export/import
- [ ] Responsive design on all breakpoints
- [ ] Keyboard navigation
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility

### 8.2 Validation Methods

#### 8.2.1 User Acceptance Testing
- **Scenario 1**: First-time user creates first task within 2 minutes
- **Scenario 2**: Power user creates task with webhook notification in < 5 minutes
- **Scenario 3**: User successfully receives webhook notification
- **Scenario 4**: User exports and imports data without errors
- **Scenario 5**: User navigates entire application using keyboard only

#### 8.2.2 Performance Validation
```javascript
// Performance measurement examples
console.time('Task Creation');
await taskService.createTask(validTaskData);
console.timeEnd('Task Creation');  // Should be < 100ms

console.time('Task Retrieval (10k tasks)');
await taskService.getTasks();
console.timeEnd('Task Retrieval (10k tasks)');  // Should be < 500ms
```

#### 8.2.3 Design System Validation
- **Color Usage**: Verify `{colors.primary}` only used for webhook CTAs
- **Typography**: Verify all headings use `ss01, ss02` stylistic sets
- **Components**: Verify all buttons use `{rounded.full}`
- **Spacing**: Verify all spacing uses 4px/8px grid
- **Accessibility**: Verify WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
